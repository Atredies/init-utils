# init-utils

Contains useful scripts for a variety of uses such as:

- [x] Linux (Bash, Python)
- [x] Windows (Powershell, Python)
- [x] Infra as code (Ansible, Docker, etc...)
- [x] Cloud (AWS and Azure)
- [x] Web (HTML)

These scripts are intended to be taken and adapted.
The scripts are not the greatest the world has ever seen, but the intention here is to: "Not reinvent the wheel" and just copy-pasta (and adapt) the logic that you need
